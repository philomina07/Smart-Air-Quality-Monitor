Project Summary

The Air Quality Monitor is an IoT-based system designed to measure and display real-time air quality data using an ESP32 microcontroller. 
It uses sensors like DHT11 for temperature and humidity and MQ135 for detecting harmful gases such as CO₂ and other volatile compounds. 
The readings are displayed on an LCD screen and transmitted to the Blynk IoT platform, allowing users to monitor environmental conditions remotely through their smartphone.

Purpose of the Project

The main purpose of the Air Quality Monitor is to create a low-cost, portable, and reliable system that helps users understand and track air pollution levels in their surroundings.
It aims to:

Raise awareness about environmental health and pollution.

Enable users to take timely actions when air quality drops.

Provide real-time insights for improving indoor or outdoor air quality.

Serve as a learning project for IoT, sensors, and environmental monitoring systems.
